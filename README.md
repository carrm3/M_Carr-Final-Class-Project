Objective of the project

  The object of this project was to determine how has red snapper distribution changed with its population and how has that change 
impacted interactions with other reef species (possibly competition or predation). 


Structure of the code-base including dependencies

  Utilizing a multiple linear regression model, specifically, the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) function that is found in the (nlme) package 
within r software. 

The strutuere of the data that is required as input including the metadata

  Red Snapper and Black Sea Bass will be used as the dependent variables while using year, date, longitude, latitude, station number, 
depth, temperature, salinity, and bottom habitat type as the independent variables. This will be used to estimate Red Snapper and Black Sea Bass abundance over time.
